Notes, data, and R programs from the [2023 Topology for Data Science Conference](https://comptag.github.io/t4ds/) Apr 21-23, 2023 at Montana State University at Bozeman, Montana

- [Session 1](\session1) Introduction to topology, defining shape, Euler characteristics, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, maps and homeomorphisms, and topological invariants
- [Session 2](\session2) Data wrangling in R, reading external data, basic visualizations, loading GIS data, plotting shapefiles and polygons
- [Session 3](\session3) Topological descriptors, vietoris-rips filtrations, lower-star filtrations on images, R implementation, persistent homology barcodes and diagrams across filtrations
- [Session 4](\session4) Simple filtratinos in TDA, metric stability, bottlenect distances between persistence diagrams, and implementation in R
- [Session 5](\session5) Domain-specific TDA applications, applied TDA on shape of Montana glaciers, and comparing and contrasting shape differences with changes in glacial health
